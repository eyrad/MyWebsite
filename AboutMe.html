	<p>It's great to meet you. I'm really excited to see where this coding journey will take me.</p>

	<p>I'm an easy going person, who likes to have fun and not take things too seriously. I love to watch and play all sports and enjoy hanging out with friends. I grew up just outside of Houston, Texas and almost can't believe that I have been in New York City for 4 years. I have a love/hate relationship with the Big Apple, but genuinely believe that this is exactly where I am supposed to be right now. Here are a few more interesting facts about me:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I love yellow cake with vanilla frosting.</li>
		<li>I hate going to the dentist.</li>
		<li>I am Ghanaian American.</li>
		<li>I love to drop it like it's hot.</li>
		<li>My favorite outfit is a crisp white T-shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers.</li>
		<li>I am not much of a planner; I prefer to take things one day at a time.</li>
	</ul>
